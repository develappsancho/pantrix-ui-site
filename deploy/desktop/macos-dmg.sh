# The app is the one `./gradlew :app:desktopApp:createDistributable` writes, which Compose signs ad hoc. Compose's own
# signing finds the certificate by its name and hands that name to codesign, which does not find a name with letters
# beyond ASCII; so the app is signed here, by the certificate's hash, as Compose would sign it: the native libraries
# inside the jars, every library and executable of the runtime, the runtime, then the app with the JVM's
# entitlements. The notarization takes the keychain profile `pantrix-notary` (`xcrun notarytool store-credentials`),
# so no password passes through here.
